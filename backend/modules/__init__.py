# backend/modules/__init__.py

# This file can be empty, or you can use it to make imports easier.
# For example, if you want to do `from modules import filename_manager`
# from within the `backend` package or its sub-packages.

# You could also selectively expose functions:
# from .filename_manager import add_filename_prefix_api
# from .pdf_processor import remove_pdf_pages_api # Assuming you create this

# For now, keeping it simple. Ensure Python treats `modules` as a package.
